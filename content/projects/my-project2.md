## FA 2019 - Electronic Art Emotion Project

In 2019, I took a class on electronic art. As my final project, I sent a survey out to my classmates, asking them what sounds and sensations made them feel specific emotions. These included contentment, anger, anxiety, and dread.

After collecting their results, I combined them to create collages expressing each of these emotions. I also created soundscapes to play behind each collage. The video is linked below.
