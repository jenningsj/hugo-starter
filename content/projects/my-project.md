## Meadiaville Listening Project

![meadiaville listening project poster](/postcardmeadiaville-1.png)


This is the poster for Meadiaville Listening Project season 4, Lake Effect Love: Relationships in the Rust Belt. This was an ethnographic study of online dating in Meadville, PA. The 4 podcast series followed Meadville locals recounting their experience using dating apps. 

Once the interviews were coded and the podcasts were made, we had a listening party at Firehouse, a local restuarant. Links to the actual podcasts will be available at a later time.
