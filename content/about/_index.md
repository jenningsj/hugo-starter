# Rowen

I am a college student from New York, studying Integrative Informatics and Communications. My main focus is ethics, especially in online spaces. I've worked to analyze how social media platforms collect user information and use it to influence consumers. Namely, I've conducted ethnographic research on online romance in the Meadville, PA and the Rust Belt generally. My final comprehension assignment focuses on the neoliberal ideologies pushed onto queer people online. Now, I'm looking to branch out and further explore the impacts of online experience on consumers. I also create art, and look forward to incorporating the two together.
