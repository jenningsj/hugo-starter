## About

  My portfolio website focuses on my interest in data analytics and online media consumption. In my about section, I list a few of the projects I've worked on that speak on these topics. I worked on the Meadiaville Listening Project during its online dating season, though there is some issue finding this porject online now (the professor went on leave at the beginning of this year, unfortunately). I also reference my senior thesis project, which does not have any components that are ready to view yet. I've included my resume, which links to another project I've worked on. The Glacier's Edge project is an effort to increase tourism and revenue in Northwestern Pennsylvania. I worked for a semester on data collection, listing and finding addresses for all of the outdoor assets in the area. 
  Because my interests are so incredibly intertwined with media and media studies, I felt it was important to include that I am knowledgeable about video and audio media platforms. I included my work history as an AV tech assistant, and I've included projects I've done using multiple forms of digital media. I hope that this website and its strange collection of projects serves to demonstrate how well rounded I am as a potential employee.
